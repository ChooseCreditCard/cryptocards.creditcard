      <h2>What Counts as a “Crypto Card” Today?</h2>
      <p>Crypto credit cards are traditional network cards (Visa, Mastercard or similar) that are tightly integrated with a crypto platform. They may let you spend directly from an exchange balance, earn rewards in tokens, or use stablecoins as the underlying funding source.</p>
      <p>Some products behave like standard reward cards with a crypto-flavored loyalty program, while others are deeply embedded in on-chain ecosystems, including governance tokens, staking tiers and dedicated “cardholder clubs.” Understanding which model you are dealing with is critical when you evaluate risk and usability.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Custodial vs Non-Custodial Setups</h2>
      <p>Many crypto cards are custodial: the issuer or partner exchange holds your assets, manages private keys and handles conversion when you spend. In practice, you interact through an app and never touch wallets or seed phrases, but you rely fully on the platform’s security and solvency.</p>
      <p>Non-custodial or semi-custodial models push more control to the user, sometimes linking card funding to DeFi positions, self-custody wallets or smart contracts. These products can give more transparency and control, but they also shift responsibility for key management and on-chain risk back to you.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Token, Stablecoin & Fiat Funding Models</h2>
      <p>Crypto cards can draw value from different sources: a basket of volatile tokens, a single platform token, stablecoins or plain fiat balances. Volatile-asset funding exposes you to price swings every time you spend, while stablecoin-backed setups aim to keep the currency risk lower.</p>
      <p>Some issuers also allow you to preload fiat via bank transfer and then simply earn rewards in crypto. That structure keeps everyday spending predictable while still participating in a token ecosystem on the reward side.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Tiered Programs, Staking & Ecosystem Lock-In</h2>
      <p>Many crypto card ecosystems use tiered structures: staking or locking a certain amount of a native token grants higher rewards, lower fees or extra perks such as partner rebates and subscriptions. These tiers can be attractive, but they also create concentration risk in a single token or platform.</p>
      <p>Before committing to a tier, it is worth considering how liquid the token is, what happens if rewards or rules change, and whether the promised benefits still justify the lock-up if prices move sharply.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Geography, Regulation & Platform Risk</h2>
      <p>Crypto card availability is heavily influenced by regulation, card-network partnerships and local licensing. A card that is heavily marketed globally may in practice be limited to a small number of countries or require additional KYC steps.</p>
      <p>Platform risk also matters: some programs have changed terms, reduced rewards or even shut down with short notice in response to market or regulatory events. Long-term users should keep an eye on issuer communications, financial health and any changes to regional support.</p>
