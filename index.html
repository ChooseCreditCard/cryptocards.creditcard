        <p class="hero-lead">
          “Crypto cards” all promise that you can spend digital assets through a familiar plastic or virtual card – but the underlying structures differ a lot. This page looks at crypto-linked cards as a category, not a single issuer.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Counts as a “Crypto Credit Card”?</h2>
      <p>When people talk about “crypto credit cards”, they often mix together several product types. Some are true credit cards with a revolving line of credit. Others are debit or prepaid cards linked to a crypto wallet or exchange account.</p>
      <p>From a user perspective, the key idea is that <strong>you fund the system with crypto</strong> – but most purchases are still settled over traditional card networks like Visa or Mastercard, using conventional fiat currency at the point of sale.</p>
      <p>CryptoCards.Creditcard focuses on category-level structures and risk points, so you can later interpret issuer-specific offers with less marketing noise.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card structures -->
    <section id="structures" class="section">
      <h2>Common Structures for Crypto-Linked Cards</h2>
      <p>Even within the “crypto card” label, there are multiple technical and legal structures. Understanding which bucket a product belongs to helps you compare fees, protections and risk.</p>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Type</th>
              <th>How It’s Funded</th>
              <th>Key Characteristics</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Exchange-linked debit</td>
              <td>Balance held at a crypto exchange, converted to fiat</td>
              <td>Looks like a debit card to the merchant; relies on the exchange to manage conversion and risk.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Prepaid crypto card</td>
              <td>Top up a fiat balance using crypto</td>
              <td>Crypto is sold ahead of time, then you spend down a stored-value balance like any prepaid card.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Credit card with crypto rewards</td>
              <td>Traditional credit line; rewards paid in tokens or crypto</td>
              <td>Spending is in fiat; rewards are granted in a supported digital asset instead of points or cash.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Hybrid Web3 wallets</td>
              <td>Wallet front-end that routes to on/off-ramp providers</td>
              <td>More flexible on the front-end, but still dependent on regulated partners for card issuance.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Regulation, consumer protections and tax treatment vary across these structures, even if the card art and apps look similar.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- What to compare -->
    <section id="compare" class="section">
      <h2>What to Compare Across Crypto Card Offers</h2>
      <p>Instead of focusing only on headline rewards or token incentives, it often makes sense to compare a few deeper dimensions that affect real-world cost and usability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversion model:</strong> Real-time vs preloaded, and which exchange rate and spread are used.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees &amp; FX:</strong> Crypto-conversion fees, FX margins, ATM charges and network fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Cash, points, stablecoins or volatile tokens – and any lock-ups or staking requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>On/off-ramp partners:</strong> Which custodians, exchanges or banks sit between you and the merchant.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance &amp; reporting:</strong> Statements, CSV exports and any built-in tax reporting tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For some users, a simple travel or FX-focused card with transparent fees may still be more predictable than a complex crypto-linked setup with multiple moving parts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Volatility and Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>
      <p>Crypto cards sit at the intersection of two regulated worlds: payments and digital assets. That means you face not only market volatility, but also changing rules, platform risk and potential outages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asset volatility can change the real value of your balance between loading and spending.</li>
        <li>Exchange or issuer incidents can temporarily block card usage or withdrawals.</li>
        <li>Regulatory changes may affect which jurisdictions or assets are supported.</li>
        <li>Each conversion from crypto to fiat may have tax implications in some countries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This minisite is not legal, tax or investment advice. For complex situations, independent professional guidance is usually a good idea.</p>
